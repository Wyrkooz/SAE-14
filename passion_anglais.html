            <h2>Information technology</h2>
            <p>I've always had a passion for computers. I've always played video games and wanted to learn more about the technologies that surround me. At the age of 13, I was lucky enough to be able to build my own PC all by myself, to understand a little more about how each component works. What's more, in the third year of secondary school, I did my work placement in a company's IT department. I was able to find out how the IT system works, see the server room and learn a few basics about data protection (RGPD), which later made me want to study in these areas.</p>

            <h2>Automotive</h2>
            <p>I've always had a passion for cars. I've always found the mechanics behind each car fascinating. What I also like is that behind each model, behind each brand, there's a whole story that I love to discover. My favourite brands are Mercedes and Porsche and I was lucky enough to go to Stuttgart in Germany to visit the Mercedes Benz Museum and the Porsche Museum. I was able to find out more about the history of each brand, from its creation to the present day.</p>

            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>Like many of us, football has always been much more than just a sport. I've always played football as a hobby, but 1 year ago I joined a club to turn my passion into a real thing. For me, football isn't just a sport, it's an integral part of who I am. This sport teaches us not just to 'run after a ball' but to develop real team cohesion, a sense of mutual support and values and principles that are now part of my personality.</p>
